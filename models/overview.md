## About Me

My name is Ian Cooper, I am a Solution Architect at dbt Labs but I am also a massive motorsport fan and aspiring race car driver (we can all dream right??).

Motorsport encompasses a lot of skills I enjoy including engineering, driving techniques and **data analytics**. I recently got into tracking myself and half the fun is actually analyzing the data between sessions or after the track event... I may or may not have another dbt Project for that.

## About Dataset

### Context
This is a dataset pulled from Kaggle called [Formula 1 World Championship (1950 - 2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=status.csv).

Formula 1 (a.k.a. F1 or Formula One) is the highest class of single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and owned by the Formula One Group. The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.

### Content
The dataset consists of all information on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 till the latest 2023 season.

### Acknowledgements
The data is compiled from [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/).

*"Races are won at the track. Championships are won at the factory."* - Mercedes (2019)

With the amount of data being captured, analyzed and used to design, build and drive the Formula 1 cars is astounding. It is a global sport being followed by millions of people worldwide and it is very fascinating to see drivers pushing their limit in these vehicles to become the fastest racers in the world!
